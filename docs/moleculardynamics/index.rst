Molecular dynamics
##################

This chapter discusses DFTB+ calculations where the (classical) dynamics of the
atoms are simulated in different thermodynamical ensembles and with different
methods of integrating the equations of motion.

Molecular dynamics can be used to provide information which is not easily
accessible from static simulations. This includes properties such as anharmonic
vibrational modes, the stability of different structures at finite temperatures,
or to explore the range of structural minima the system can adopt.
