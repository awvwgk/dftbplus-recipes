Phonon calculations with phonopy
================================

The `phonopy <http://atztogo.github.io/phonopy/>`_ code can calculate
a range of harmonic and quasi-harmonic vibrational properties and from
version 2.0 onwards supports DFTB+. Information about how to install
phonopy is `available
<http://atztogo.github.io/phonopy/install.html>`_, it is also
available on conda-forge::

  mamba install -c conda-forge phonopy

The below examples were tested with phonopy v2.14.0.

Phonon band structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. only :: builder_html or readthedocs

   [Input: `recipes/properties/phononbs/`]

The diamond lattice has very high symmetry, hence a phonon band structure can be
obtained with a single calculation. A conventional unit cell with relaxed
lattice constant is provided in `geo.gen` (the phonopy input assumes this is the
name of the supplied starting geometry).

The DFTB+ input needs to calculate the atomic forces and also to write a results
tag file, hence the `dftb_in.hsd` input contains lines including::
  
  Analysis = {
    # required option for phonopy
    CalculateForces = Yes
  }
  Options = {
    # Required options for storing data needed by phonopy
    WriteResultsTag = Yes
  }

The (single) distorted geometry and the required `phonopy_disp.yaml` file is then
generated with the command ::

   phonopy -d --dim="4 4 4" --dftb+

This constructs a 4x4x4 supercell of the primitive cell and saves the
undistorted and distorted supercells as `geo.genS` and `geo.genS-001`
respectively. Note that you should test the phonon band structure is
converged with respect to the number of repeats used in making the
supercell (and likewise for any other properties of interest), as well
as the number of k-points used in the DFTB+ calculation.

For the single (in this case) generated `geo.genS-*` file, calculate
the forces on the atoms, using DFTB+ and retaining the resulting
`results.tag` file ::

  dftb+

Then create the required `FORCE_SETS` file ::

  phonopy -f results.tag --dftb+

This assumes that the `results.tag` and `phonopy_disp.yaml` files are
in the same directory (for more complex cases this stage of the
phonopy calculation should be run in the same directory as
`phonopy_disp.yaml` file and paths given to directories containing the
DFTB+ output `results.tag` files).

Then specify the path in the Brillouin zone you are interested in in
`band.conf` (see the `phonopy documentation
<https://atztogo.github.io/phonopy/setting-tags.html#band-structure-related-tags>`_),
and post-process the phonopy data, again providing the dimensions of
the the supercell repeat. This can either be on the command line or in
the settings file (a `DIM` file)::

   phonopy -p band.conf --dim="4 4 4" --dftb+

Finally, you can save the band structure data in gnuplot format ::

  phonopy-bandplot --gnuplot band.yaml > band.dat

The resulting band structure for the mio carbon model is shown in
:numref:`fig_phonopy_diamond`.

Lower symmetry structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For lower symmetry geometries, multiple `geo.genS-*` files will be
generated.

Assuming the `dftb_in.hsd` file expects the geometry to be called
geo.gen and knows an absolute path to the Slater-Koster data, a simple
bash shell loop to run these calculations could look like ::

  for struct in geo.genS-*
  do
    export dir=$(echo $struct | sed 's/geo.genS-//g')
    echo "Processing $dir"
    mkdir $dir
    cp $struct $dir/geo.genS-001
    cp dftb_in.hsd $dir
    cd $dir
    dftb+
    cd ..
  done

In practice, the separate DFTB+ calculations could be submitted to a
queueing system.

As separate calculation outputs are then in sub-directories, phonopy
processing of the multiple results.tag files would be done with ::

  phonopy -f [0-9][0-9][0-9]/results.tag --dftb+
